## Philosophy

> _“Only start things you are willing to finish with dedication.”_

KoppaJS favors explicit behavior, readable systems, and deliberate repository contracts.

Contributions should preserve those traits:

- keep behavior understandable and traceable
- prefer explicit contracts over hidden convention
- update documentation when the owned contract changes
- leave the repository in a state where both humans and AI agents can recover intent locally

## Repository Governance

Before structural, workflow, or user-visible changes, read the local governance layer:

- [DECISION_HIERARCHY.md](./DECISION_HIERARCHY.md)
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md](./DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md)
- [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](./TESTING_STRATEGY.md)
- [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md)
- [docs/specs/README.md](./docs/specs/README.md)
- [docs/specs/repository-documentation-contract.md](./docs/specs/repository-documentation-contract.md)
- [docs/specs/site-runtime-baseline.md](./docs/specs/site-runtime-baseline.md)

If your change moves package behavior, contributor workflow, or governed file shape, update the corresponding documentation in the same change.

---

## Documentation Contract

The root documents `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` are governed by [docs/specs/repository-documentation-contract.md](./docs/specs/repository-documentation-contract.md).

Before committing, run:

```bash
npm run check:docs
```

The local pre-commit hook runs the same guard and blocks the commit when the contract fails.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- npm >= 10

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you plan to run browser tests locally, install the Chromium test browser:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Development Workflow

Use the smallest change that solves the actual problem.

A safe default workflow is:

1. Read the affected code, tests, and local governance docs before changing behavior.
2. Update the owned specs and governed root docs in the same change when the contract moves.
3. Run `npm run check:docs` before broader quality checks.
4. Run the repository quality gates that cover the affected behavior.
5. Keep unrelated edits out of the same change whenever possible.

Repository-specific focus for this project:

- Keep the website repository focused on the public web presence, package positioning, and support narrative.
- Keep documentation depth in `koppajs-documentation` and package-specific implementation details in their owning repos.
- Prefer route-level changes that improve discovery and adoption over adding reference-doc content here.

## Code Style & Quality

All KoppaJS repositories value clarity over cleverness.

Expectations for changes in this repository:

- keep implementations explicit and easy to review
- prefer updating governing docs over leaving intent implicit
- keep quality-gate commands passing before asking for review
- do not silently change public behavior or contributor workflow

<p align="right">(<a href="#contributing-top">back to top</a>)</p>

---

## Commit Conventions

KoppaJS uses **Conventional Commits**.

Example:

```text
feat: harden documentation contract validation
```

Keep commit scope aligned with the actual repository change.

---

## Testing Guidelines

Every user-visible or contract-visible change should leave verification behind.

That means:

- update specs when behavior changes
- add or adjust automated tests when executable behavior changes
- run the repository commands that cover the affected area
- keep the documentation contract valid when the root docs change
- rerun Playwright coverage when routing, CTA flow, or layout behavior changes

## Releasing

Repository milestones are documented in `CHANGELOG.md` when a tagged website baseline is created.

When a release changes the public contract, update `CHANGELOG.md`, the relevant specs, the governed root documents, and [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) together when the workflow meaning moves.
